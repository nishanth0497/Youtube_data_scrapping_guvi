## Youtube_data_scrapping_and_analysis

### _Overview_:
 Extract youtube data using Google's youtube API and create a datalake in MongoDB. Retrieve the data and perform analysis using sql

### _Details_:
 1. This repository consists of _youtube_scrapping.py_ file, which enables users to collect data from any youtube channel. 
      * -Technology needed : **_Youtube api_ , _Python_**
        
 2. We then upload or warehouse the data to MongoDB - A Non-relational database which can handle unstructured data. If you observe youtube data, it is primarily semi-structured. It is wise to use a Non-relational database to store and organise or structure it using SQL.
      * -Technology needed: **_Mongodb_**
        
 3. Next step involves migrating the to SQL, here _MySQL_ is used, and create schema/database, thus structuring it, based on our requirements and write necessary queries to analyze the data 
      * -Technology needed: **_MySql_ or _SQLite_**
        
 4. Finally, craete a web app using streamlit - a python based web development package which gives you a minimalist tools that are sufficient to create and display your reports in an interactive way.
      * -Technology needed: **_streamlit_**
